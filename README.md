## Weather App

### Project Description

This web application allows users to check the current weather in the city specified by the user in the input field. For better visual representation, it also displays an image relevant to the request. This app was created for the purpose of practicing with APIs.

### Requirements

To run this app you will need:
* An Openweathermap API key, which you can obtain by registering a **free account** on their website: https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This step is vital for this weather application to work.
* An Unsplash API key. To get one, go to the Unsplash website https://unsplash.com, register a **free account**, log in, then go to the application dashboard and click "New Application".
> [!NOTE]
> This step is optional as it allows you to fetch images for the application background. In case you didn't get an image API key, the default background will be set.
